# Requirements

## Basic Function
The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the front and rear, although not all cars have wipers on the rear side. Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield. When the wiper switch is in the off position, the wiper will not function. When the wiper switch is in low-speed mode, the wiper will work at low speed. Accordingly, when the wiper switch is in high-speed mode, the wiper will work at a fairly high speed.


## Working of proposed system

I am using four different coloured LEDs instead of wipers.Â 

Step 1: When the blue button is pressed ONCE for 2 seconds, the vehicle will be in ACC mode and the RED LED will start blinking constantly.

Step 2: When the blue button is pressed again for 1 second, the vehicle will be in ignition mode and the orange, blue, and green LEDs will start blinking at 1 Hz               frequency.

Step 3: When the blue button is pressed again for 1 second, the speed of the LED changes from 1 Hz to 4 HZ.

Step 4: When the blue button is pressed again for 1 second, the speed of the LED changes from 4 Hz to 8Hz.

Step 5; When the blue button is pressed again, the LED turns off.

## SWOT(STRENGTH,WEAKNESS,OPPORTUNITY,THREATS)

# * Strength
    1. Safety
    2. Visibility
    3. We can change the speed of wiper.
    
# * Weakness
    1. Burned out fuse
    2. Broken Wiper control
    3. High cost
    4. Not automatic
    
 # * Threats
     1. failer in wiper motor
     2. Damanged wiper blades
